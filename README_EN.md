## Contribution Guide

If you have any ideas, feel free to open an `issue` or submit a `PR`. If you want to add a new game, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new game component under the [src/components/games/](https://github.com/zhenghaoyang24/webgames/tree/master/src/components/games) directory (this component should contain all the game logic), for example, `Game.vue`.
2. Add the new game information in [src/data/gameList.ts](https://github.com/zhenghaoyang24/webgames/blob/master/src/data/gameList.ts):

   ```typescript
   {
     name: 'Game Name',
     component: 'Component Name',
     description: 'Game Description',
     loadComponent: () => import('@/components/games/Game.vue'),
   }
   ```

3. The game will automatically appear in the game list and can be played directly by clicking on it.
